Awesome to see that you are willing to sponsor my [work](@/projects.md).

By sponsoring me, you'll help me pay the bills. This allows me to allocate more
time to work on amazing open projects, for everyone. This is what I truly
[love](@/about.md) to do, but it needs support from some enthusiastic and
generous followers.

As I'm still a student, I must set aside most of my free time to work on a job.
I hope to be able to work full-time on open-source projects in the future. You
could help kick-start this goal to make this a reality.

Any amount is helpful, and everything is appreciated.

A **big** thanks to all awesome supporters!

~ Tim
