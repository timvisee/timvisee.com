Hey there!

Awesome to see that you may be willing to sponsor my [work](@/projects.md).

By sponsoring me, you'll help me pay the bills. This allows me to allocate more
time to work on amazing open projects, for everyone. This is what I truly
[love](@/about.md) to do, but it requires support from some generous followers.

Below I've provided a few official channels you could use to sponsor me.
Any amount is helpful, and everything is welcome.

A big thanks to **all** awesome supporters!

~ Tim
