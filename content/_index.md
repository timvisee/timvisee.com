Welcome to my personal website.

This website shows what projects I work on.
See an overview on the [Projects](@/projects.md) page.
I prefer to make projects free and open-source, therefore most are available on
my [GitHub][github] and [GitLab][gitlab] profiles.

I also use this website for basic blogging to share cool code snippets, project
releases, simple tutorials, useful findings and to share my experience with
various topics I'm interested in.
