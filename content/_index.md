Welcome to my personal website!

This website shows what projects I work on.
You can find an overview on the [Projects](@/projects.md) page.
I prefer to make projects free and open-source, therefore most are available on
my [GitHub][github] and [GitLab][gitlab] profiles.

I also use this website as a platform for basic [blogging](@/blog/_index.md).
The content is mainly about programming, security and ramblings on other
technical interests of mine.
The opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect my current or previous
employers'.
