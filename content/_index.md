Welcome to my personal website.

This website shows what I'm currently working on, and what I've worked on in the
past. See an overview on the [Projects](@/projects.md) page. I usually prefer to
open-source my personal projects, therefore most of them are available on my
[GitHub][github] and [GitLab][gitlab] profile.

I intend to use this website as simple blog platform to share cool code
snippets, project releases, simple tutorials, useful findings and to share my
experience with various topics I'm interested in.
