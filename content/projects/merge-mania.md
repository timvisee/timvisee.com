A real-time team based merging/trading game to play using your phone.

- Played in teams for a set time period
- Players, in a team, use their phone to play the game
- Each team has _money_, _energy_ and an inventory grid with their _items_
- Factory items, on your grid, produce items at a set interval, on your grid
- **Merge** two items of the same type into a better item
- Discover new items and tiers as you play
- Players run between outposts to earn _energy_
- _Energy_ is used to buy additional _factories_ on the grid, producing new items
- Buy lots of factories to gain items as quickly as possible
- Merge & sell smart to earn as much as possible
- After playing, the team earning the most wins
