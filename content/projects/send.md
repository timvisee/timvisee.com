Send lets you share files with end-to-end encryption and a link that
automatically expires. So you can keep what you share private and make sure your
stuff doesnâ€™t stay online forever.

Send has originally been developed by Mozilla, but was discontinued. I forked
the project as a community effort to keep the project up-to-date and alive.

I provide a [public instance](https://send.vis.ee) as part of this effort. Find
a list of other instances [here][instances]. Or host [your own][deployment]
instance.
